PREFACE

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
Personally I have been missing clear coupling and simplicity between
electromagnetism and quantum mechanics modelling, which is now fuzzy area,
overloaded with terms. Peoples have done lot of good work and existing models
are usable for the practical life. Still there is need to go back in time and
lift again obvious possible connection between electromagnetism and quantum
physics on the table, if there is any possibility to get any clearance to our
relativistic world. It's done with the lazy mathematicians method: Guess the
correct answer and let the others to proof that your and other historic
proposals were right. Here correct answer is found with the simple "Duck test":
"If it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck".
In practice I state that there is only electromagnetism, energy and space in
our relativistic world, noting else, nothing less. Electromagnetism itself is
kind of progressing phonomenon, supporting causality and offers for humans
possibility to define time which is handy for modelling and tracking this
causality, but time definition itself is also based to electromagnetism,
energy and space, the major incredients just proposed for our generally
relativistic world. I really do not go to mathematic models, because then we
overload ourselves and loose our target under mass of details. I try to explain
needed change in our thinking in simplistic way, referring things we know from
general relativity.

Hopefully you'll get some ideas from here for your professional life!
