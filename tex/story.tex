\section{Supposition}
\label{supposition}
\index{supposition}
Our generally relativistic world we see consists only from electromagnetism,
energy and space. Nothing else is there !

Electromagnetism itself is kind of progressing phenomenon, supporting causality
and offers for humans possibility to define time, which is handy for modeling
and tracking this causality, but time definition itself is based to
electromagnetism, energy and space, the major ingredients what just proposed
for our generally relativistic world.

\section{Hypothesis}
\label{hypothesis}
\index{hypothesis}

Hypothesis is that subatomic particles electron, positron, proton and
antiproton are actually pure electromagnetic waveforms curled up in it's own
space.

Schwinger limit (Julian Schwinger \cite{SchwingerLimit}) gives limits for
electric field $E_c~=1.23 EV/m$ (Eksa Volt / meter) and magnetic field
$B_c~=4.41 GT$ (Giga Tesla) after we can see nonlinearity in scale of
electron Compton wavelength (Arthur Compton \cite{ComptonWavelength}) 
$\lambda_e=2426 fm$.


Strong electromagnetic fields in Compton wavelength scale
$(\lambda=\frac{h}{mc})$
can produce discrete numerable curled waveforms
$(\bar{\lambda}=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi})$,
$\bar{\lambda}_e=386 fm$,
%\bar{\lambda}\lambdabar\lambdaslash\textcrlambda
harmonics where wave goes with light speed, but from local observers
perspective outside from curled space, time seems to be stopped and we see kind
of frozen representation from curled wave.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reduced_plank_constant} 
	\hbar
	= \frac{6.582119569}{10^{16}}[eVs]
	= \frac{1.054571817}{10^{34}}[Js]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:plank_constant} % SI-units and other

%	= \frac{1.602C\cdot4.136V}{10^{34}Hz}
	= \frac{6.62607015}{10^{34}}\left[\frac{J}{Hz}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:electron_rest_mass}
	m_e=\frac{E_e}{c^2}
%	=\frac{E_e [eV]}{c^2 \left[\frac{m^2}{s^2}\right]}
%	=m_e\frac{[J]}{\left[\frac{m^2}{s^2}\right]}
%	=m_e\frac{[kg\frac{m^2}{s^2}]}{\left[\frac{m^2}{s^2}\right]}
%	=m_e[kg]
\end{equation}

Electron curled spacetime radius $\bar{\lambda}_e$ is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gamma_lenght} % Electron annihilation induced gamma ray wavelength 
	\bar{\lambda}_e=\frac{\hbar}{m_ec}
	=\frac{\hbar c}{E_e}
	=\frac{6.58eVs\cdot299\frac{m}{s}}{10^{13}\cdot511eV}
%	=\frac{6.582119569eVs\cdot299792458\frac{m}{s}}{10^{16}\cdot510998.95069eV}
	=386fm
%	=386.159267407fm
%	=0.386pm
\end{equation}
and diameter $\diameter_e=772 fm$.


Electron annihilation released $\gamma$ -photon wavelenght $\lambda_\gamma$ is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gamma_lenght} % Electron annihilation induced gamma ray wavelength 
	\lambda_\gamma=\frac{h}{m_ec}
%	=\lambda_\gamma\frac{\left[\frac{eV}{Hz}\right]}{[kg]\left[\frac{m}{s}\right]}
%	=\lambda_\gamma\frac{[Js]}{\left[kg\frac{m}{s}\right]}
%	=\lambda_\gamma\frac{\left[kg\frac{m^2}{s}\right]}{\left[kg\frac{m}{s}\right]}
%	=\lambda_\gamma[m]
	=\frac{hc}{E_e}
	=\frac{4.14eVs\cdot299\frac{m}{s}}{10^{12}\cdot511eV}
%	=\frac{4.135667696eVs\cdot299792458\frac{m}{s}}{10^{15}\cdot510998.95069eV}

\end{equation}

There are few possibilities what has happened; Either space is bending with
light speed in curl so wave seems to be static or time has been stopped
because wave in curl curving proceeds with light speed or both because light
speed is reached in formed curl, kind of total internal reflection forming
standing wave having only one peak visible for externals and other peak is
fully internal, only visible inside of curl. This bending makes curled wave
behave like noticeable charged particle, still being a discrete standing wave
due to unlinearity making it possible to exist.

Curling can create discrete numbered relativistic bending forms to space, and
we call known stable curl forms to electron, positron, proton and antiproton.

Each curl bend space around and bending is called to gravity. Electron is
lowest energy curl which outside visible electric field is negative and other
handed antiparticle positron has positive electric towards outside.

Because of this outside bended electric field, local observer can accelerate
and move electrons and positrons using external electromagnetic field. When
electron, it's curl is accelerated with the external electric field it will
face relativistic Doppler effect it's wave is coming shorter which means that
curled wave gains more energy and more mass. While decelerated curl wavelength
widens and energy is lost to breaking against the external field.

Proton and antiproton next energy rich left and right hand sided electromagnetic
field stable curls we know. Proton has positive field outwards and antiproton
has negative field outwards. While energy is much bigger than electron has the
wavelength of curl is shorter and curl size is smaller. Tight curl forms
stronger bend to space and we see it as stronger gravity.

Electron negative electric field and proton positive electric field pull curls
towards each other and those can superposition over the each other still
maintaining own separate curls, proton smaller and electron bigger.

When curl and it's anticurl meet happens annihilation\cite{Annihilation} where
curl opens, gravity vanish and energy is again in electromagnetic form on local
space. Pair production\cite{PairProduction} can happen again from this released
energy.

\section{So called "weak interaction"}
\label{weak_interaction}
\index{weak interaction}

With the additional energy electron-curl $2426fm$\cite{ComptonWavelength}
can reach proton-curl size $1.321fm$ and form new harmonic curl called neutron
$1.319fm$. Due to needed extra energy neutron curl, even it's electric fields
sum outside seem to be zero, is affected by external electric disturbances and
cause neutron curl decay to proton and electron curl, average time to decay is
about fifteen minutes.

This decay is called to beta $\beta$-decay to and acting force is called to
weak force. Forces come during curl creation from electron Compton wavelength
shortening taken energy -- during size shrinking for electric field
strengthening done work, and proton positive, electron negative electric fields
mutual pulling force done work. These forces and work amounts are opposite
ones, partially cancel each other, causing sum force to look a like "weak
force" or "weak interaction". It's good to notice that most likely relative
forces are strong due curl internal lightspeed operation where impulse time
is shorter than it looks from outside observers perspective.

\section{So called "strong interaction"}
\label{strong_interaction}
\index{strong interaction}

There is no strong interaction at all, seen strong interaction is relativistic
electromagnetic interaction. For example proton - proton interaction is two
different proton curls interaction, electromagnetic force pulls those away from
each other starting from long distances. While curls come near by each other
starting to form common harmonic curl, common relativistic space where both
electromagnetic waves fly at light speed, and outside observer sees static view
from curl having positive electric field towards outside observer.

When these waves are near by, and they both are on nearby by light speed in they
curls, which means that relativistic electromagnetic force average affecting time,
impulse time, shorter than what static observer can see, therefore observer sees
"strong interaction" because momentum is force multiplied with time, and now time
is it's relativistic way 137\cite{FineStructureConst} times shorter electromagnetic
interaction than what observer thinks. This leads to situation where force has
to be 137 times stronger than static observer thinks to get same effect happen
\cite{TimeDilation} than what observer has been used to in he's local reference
frame.

And if change work get done, then later on uncurlig also give that same bang
backwards. Yep it's strong, but it's still electromagnetic force now forced to
happen to item going with light speed at start state in it's own curl.

This same process affects to all known more or less stable nuclides\cite{Nuclides}.
External conditions may wary, causing smaller or bigger probability for certain
combinations forming.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:clock_rate} % Lorentz factor
 \frac{1}{\gamma}=\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}~~;~~\gamma=137.035999084
%137.035999177
\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:speed_rate}
%	\beta= \frac{v}{c}= \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:speed_ratio}
%	\beta= \frac{v}{c}= \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{137^2}}= 0.99997
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}
%	\frac{v^2}{c^2}= 1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}
%%	= n^{-2}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:speed}
	\frac{v}{c}=\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}} ~=~ 0.99997
\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:reflective_ratio}
%	n^{-2}= \frac{\gamma^2-1}{\gamma^2}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:reflective_ratio}
%%	n=
%	\frac{c}{v}=
%	\sqrt{\frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2-1}}=
%	1.000026627
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:refractive_index}
%	n= \frac{c}{v}= 1.000026627
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:critical_angle}
%	\theta_c= \arcsin(\frac{v}{c}) = 1.5631 rad 89.556 deg
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:critical_reflection_angle}
%	\theta_c= \arccos(\frac{v}{c}) = 0.0077 rad 0.4438 deg
%\end{equation}

By counting from speed difference how many internal reflections $Nr_{min}$
are needed to cover full circle $2\pi~rad = 360~deg$ we notice that about
406 reflections do the thing; Wave full internal reflection from minimum
matter amount, one electron itself.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:minimum_number_of_reflections}
	Nr_{min}\geq
%	\frac {2\pi}{2\arccos(\frac{v}{c})}
	\frac {\pi}{\arccos(\frac{v}{c})}
	= 405.58
\end{equation}

\section{Big Bang}
\label{big_bang}
\index{big bang}

Even material production is shown mostly be pair production creating 50\%
matter and another 50\% of antimatter. Due to matter and antimatter
annihilation process repeats several times before local cumulation occur.
Withing existing local cumulations, probability that matter can stay longer
intact grows. There will be places having more antimatter and other places
having more antimatter. This way material probability survive longer grows.
Any asymmetry in creation will boost cumulation significantly because there
is no need to have huge distances between before massive cumulations can
occur without risk to sudden annihilation due gravity merged local material
and antimaterial cumulation collision.

Due to expected amount of energy and mass of big bang incredients must had,
we could say that black holes are in some amount reversible. Because you can't
have that amount mass, localized energy, without black hole formation before
bang.

Most obvious explanation for the big bang is supermassive antimaterial and
material back holes collision and expansion due the material annihilation in big
way, same time opening each particle curl which remove gravity and
electromagnetic radiation pressure overcome reduced gravity even pair production
try to maintain it, in these circumstances immediate annihilation occur and
radiation energy is free to escape in form big bang.

%Each kilogram corresponds to 25TWh of electricity.
%The whole human race yearly energy consumption equivalents 6400kg massloss.
