\chapter{Guessing correct answer}
\section{Supposition}
\label{supposition}
\index{supposition}
Our generally relativistic world we see consists only from electromagnetism,
energy and space. Nothing else is there !!!!

Electromagnetism itself is kind of progressing phonomenon, supporting causality
and offers for humans possibility to define time, which is handy for modelling
and tracking this causality, but time definition itself is based to
electromagnetism, energy and space, the major incredients what just proposed
for our generally relativistic world.

\section{Hypothesis}
\label{hypothesis}
\index{hypothesis}

Hypothesis is that subatomic particles electron, positron, proton and
antiproton are actually pure electromagnetic waveforms curled up in it's own
space.

Schwinger limit (Julian Schwinger \cite{SchwingerLimit}) gives limits for
electric field $E_c~=1.23 EV/m$ (Eksa Volt / meter) and magnetic field
$B_c~=4.41 GT$ (Giga Tesla) after we can see unlinearity in scale of
electron Compton wavelength (Arthur Compton \cite{ComptonWavelength}) 
$\lambda_e=2426 fm$.


Strong electromagnetic fields in Compton wavelength scale
$(\lambda=\frac{h}{mc})$
can produce discrete numerable curled waveforms
$(\bar{\lambda}=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi})$,
$\bar{\lambda}_e=772 fm$,
%\bar{\lambda}\lambdabar\lambdaslash\textcrlambda
harmonics where wave goes with light speed, but from local observers
perspective outside from curled space, time seems to be stopped and we see kind
of frozen representation from curled wave.

There are few possibilities what has happened; Either space is bending with
light speed in curl so wave seems to be static or time has been stopped
because wave in curl curving proceeds with light speed or both because light
speed is reached in formed curl.

Curling create discrete numbered relativistic bending forms to space, we call
known stable curl forms to electron, positron, proton and antiproton.

Each curl bend space around and bending is called to gravity. Electron is
lowest energy curl which outside visible electric field is negative and other
handed antiparticle positron has positive electric towards outside.

Because of this outside bended electric field, local observer can accelerate
and move electrons and positrons using external electromagmetic field. When
electron, it's curl is accelerated with the external electric field it will
face doppler effect it's wave is coming shorter which means that curled wave
gains more energy and more mass. While decelerated curl wavelenght widens and
energy is lost to breaking against external field.

Proton and antiproton next energy rich left and righthand sided electromagnetic
field stable curls we know. Proton has positive field outwards and antiproton
has negative field outwards. While energy is much bigger than electron has the
wavelenght of curl is shorter and curl size is smaller. Tight curl forms
stronger bend to space and we see it as stronger gravity.

Electron negative electric field and proton positive electric field pull curls
towards each other and those can superposition over the each other still
maintaining own separate curls, proton smaller and electron bigger.

When curl and it's anticurl meet happens annihilation\cite{Annihilation} where
curl opens, gravity vanish and energy is again in electromagnetic form on local
space. Pair production\cite{PairProduction} can happen again from this released
energy.

\section{So called "weak interaction"}
\label{weak_interaction}
\index{weak interaction}

With the additional energy electron-curl $2426fm$\cite{ComptonWavelength}
can reach proton-curl size $1.321fm$ and form new harmonic curl called neutron
$1.319fm$. Due to needed extra energy neutron curl, even it's electric fields
sum outside seem to be zero, is affected by external electric disturbances and
cause neutron curl decay to proton and electron curl, average time to decay is
about fifteen minutes.

This decay is called to beta $\beta$-decay to and acting force to weak force,
which comes from electron compton wavelenght shortening taken energy, during
smallsizing strengthening electric field done work. These forces and work
amounts are opposite ones, partially neglecting each other causing this look a
like "weak force" or "weak interaction".

\section{So called "strong interaction"}
\label{strong_interaction}
\index{strong interaction}

There is no strong interaction at all, seen strong interaction is relativistic
electromagnetic interaction. For example proton - proton interaction is two
different proton curls interaction, electromagnetic force pulls those away from
each other starting from long distances. While curls come near by each other
starting to form common harmonic curl, common relativistic space where both
electromagnetic waves fly at light speed, and outside observer sees static view
from curl having positive electric field towards outside observer.

When these waves are near by, and they both are on nearby by light speed in they
curls, which means that reativistic electromagnetic force average affecting time,
impulse time, shorter than what static observer can see, therefore observer sees
"strong interaction" because momenum is force multiplied with time, and now time
is it's reletivistic way 137\cite{FineStructureConst} times shorter electromagnetic
interaction than what observer thinks. This leads to situation where force has
to be 137 times stronger than static observer thinks to get same effect happen
\cite{TimeDilation} than what observer has been used to in he's local reference
frame.

And if change work get done, then later on uncurlig also give that same bang
backwards. Yep it's strong, but it's still electromagnetic force now forced to
happen to item going with light speed.

This same process affects to all known more or less stable nuclides\cite{Nuclides}.
External conditions may wary, ease or harden proabilites for certain combinations
forming.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:clock_rate} % Lorentz factor
 \frac{1}{\gamma}=\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}~~;~~\gamma=137.035999084
\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:speed_rate}
%	\beta= \frac{v}{c}= \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:speed_ratio}
%	\beta= \frac{v}{c}= \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{137^2}}= 0.99997
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:speed}
	v=
	% \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{137^2}}c ~=~ 
	0.99997 c
\end{equation}

\section{Big Bang}
\label{big_bang}
\index{big bang}

Even material production is shown mostly be pair production creating 50\%
matter and another 50\% of antimatter. Due to matter and antimatter
annihilation process repeats several times before local cumulations occur.
Withing local cumulations propability that matter can stay longer intact
grows. Also there will be places havin more antimatter and antimatter
propability survice longer grows. Any asymmetry in creation will boost
cumulation significantly.

Due to expected amount of energy and mass of big bang incredients must had,
we could say that black holes are in some amount reversible. Because you can't
have that amount mass, localized energy without black hole formation before
bang.

Most obvious explanation for the big bang is supermassive antimaterial and
material back holes collision and collapse due the material annihilation in big
way, same time opening each particle curl which remove gravity and
electromagnetic radiation pressure overcome reduced gravity even pair production
try to maintain it, in these circumtanced immediate annihilation occur and
radiation energy is free to escape in form big bang.

%Each kilogram corresponds to 25TWh of electricity, and 6400kg is the whole
%human race yearly energy consumption.
