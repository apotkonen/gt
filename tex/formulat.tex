\chapter{Mathematical formulation}

You are welcomed to continue this work and fill the missing.

There is need to understand electric field in it's own space and how this looks
from remote static observer viewpoint. All in detail.

\section{Pair production}
\label{pair_production}
\index{pair production}

Incoming wavelets. Curl creation in collision. Curl own space curvature
development and from observers point static situation after that.

Formulation of discrete curl curvature form, and it's relation to gravity.

\section{Annihilation}
\label{annihilation}
\index{annihilation}

Original curls in detail, how waves summing at cross section of curls
and how this leads to curl opening.

Gravity behaviour during curl curvature opening.
